    If you feel the only way to significantly reduce your carbon footprint is to live in a cave and eat beansprouts, you’d be wrong.
    Or, if you feel one individual’s effort to cut their carbon footprint is insignificant in the global climate crisis, wrong again.
    <br><br>
    Tackling climate change does not involve sacrifice. It offers an opportunity to collaborate on a global scale.

    Collaboration Earth enables each of us to collaborate with like-minded people across continents,
    countries and cultures to address Earth’s climate crisis by providing a simple tool.
    <br><br>
    CollaborationEarth credits (CE credits) are that tool. It enables people to reduce their environmental footprint without
    dramatically changing their lifestyle. Whether you live in Melbourne, Mexico City, Monte Carlo or Mumbai -
    or anywhere in between - you can join forces with other people by taking responsibility for your carbon
    footprint and trade CollaborationEarth credits.
    <br><br>
    At the 2015 Paris Climate summit, 195 countries committed to halving their carbon emissions by 2030.
    Each of us can also commit to halving our carbon emissions by joining Collaboration Earth and trade CollaborationEarth credits.
